### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Dennis, an undergrad Economics student and self-taught programmer. I started to learn software development because the huge impact that good software can make in people's lives.

Currently, I'm developing [Lazybear app for iOS](https://github.com/DennisTechnologies/Lazybear-App). Lazybear is a native iOS app that makes it easy to follow your stocks and the markets in real-time.

Also, I would like to work in an open-source project because all I've learnt has been thanks to the great community and open-source code, so it's like I have to give back something to the community. Recently, I started an [open-source project](https://github.com/denniscm190/SwiftUI-InteractiveCharts) - **currently in development** - to display responsive interactive charts easily.

If you like my work, you can sponsor me.
